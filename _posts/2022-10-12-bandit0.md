## Level Goal

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is **bandit.labs.overthewire.org**, on port 2220. The username is **bandit0** and the password is **bandit0**. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

## How to solve this level

To login to the level

```ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit0```

```ssh``` is the command needed to connect to a shell.

The first argument ```bandit.labs.overthewire.org``` is the domain (which will resolve to an IP) that you will connect to.

Using the ```-p``` flag we will specify the port we need to connect to which will be ```2220```.

Using the ```-l``` flag tell the command what user we will like to connect to the machine as, here it's ```bandit0```.

There is also a variant of the command being
```ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220```
This one may make a bit more sense as it's specifying a user at a domain.

I will be using the first method, because when I disconnect from each level I will be able to switch users easily.

Now you will be given a message saying:
```bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:```

Just enter the password from the info of the level being ```bandit0```

Now you have successfully logged in!

Hi, I’m Mathusan! I am a student living in London. I have a passion for cybersecurity as I think it’s one of the most important aspects of security holding the digital world.

I started getting into cybersecurity when I watched a show called Mr. Robot, I thought it seemed cool so I wanted to try it, knowing that most of the hacks in the show were unrealistic. The show did teach me a lot more than I thought, like how important the human side of hacking is, as a lot of social engineering techniques were used in the show.

Through further research I found out about offensive red teams and defensive blue teams. The principle of breaking into something just seemed cool to me so I ended up being drawn to that.

Here you will see my journey into the cyber, with me posting tutorials, projects, write-ups and things that I find interesting!
